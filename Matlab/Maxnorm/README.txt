Matlab code for the MaxNorm method in 'A Majorization-Minimization Gauss-Newton Method for 1-Bit Matrix Completion'

This folder includes code for implementing the MaxNorm method (from Cai and Zhou (2013)) for 1-bit matrix completion in Matlab.

===== Functions =====

Max_norm.m implements the MaxNorm method for 1-bit matrix completion with a given rank constraint parameter r. The code was modified based on the code shared by Wenxin Zhou.

MaxNorm_auto.m implements the MaxNorm method with a data-driven approach for selecting the rank parameter r. 

proj.m includes a function required for the MaxNorm method, which is provided by Wenxin Zhou.
