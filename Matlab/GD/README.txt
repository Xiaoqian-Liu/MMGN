Matlab code for the GD method in 'A Majorization-Minimization Gauss-Newton Method for 1-Bit Matrix Completion'

This folder includes code for implementing the gradient descent (GD) method for 1-bit matrix completion in Matlab.


===== Functions =====

GD_probit.m implements the GD method for 1-bit matrix completion under the probit noise model with a given rank constraint parameter r.
GD_logist.m is its counterpart for the logistic noise model.

GD_probit_auto.m implements the GD method for 1-bit matrix completion under the probit noise model with a data-driven approach for selecting the rank constraint parameter r.
GD_logist_auto.m is its counterpart for the logistic noise model.
