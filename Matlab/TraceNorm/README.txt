Matlab code for the TraceNorm method in 'A Majorization-Minimization Gauss-Newton Method for 1-Bit Matrix Completion'

This folder includes code for implementing the TraceNorm method (from Davenport et al. (2014)) for 1-bit matrix completion in Matlab.


===== Functions =====

TraceNorm_auto.m implements the TraceNorm method for 1-bit matrix completion with a data-driven approach for selecting the rank constraint parameter r.


===== Requirements =====

Our implementation of TraceNorm is built upon the Matlab toolbox '1BMC-1.2', which is available at https://mdav.ece.gatech.edu/software/. Please download the whole package and put the above functions into the main folder to ensure everything works.
