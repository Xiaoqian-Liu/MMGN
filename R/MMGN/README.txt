R code for 'A Majorization-Minimization Gauss-Newton Method for 1-Bit Matrix Completion'

This folder includes code for implementing the MMGN method for 1-bit matrix completion in R.


===== Functions =====

Please install the R package 'MMGN_0.1.0.tar.gz'. The included five functions, MMGN_probit, MMGN_logist, MMGN_probit_auto, MMGN_logist_auto, obj_1bit, and Hellinger_dist, are translated from the corresponding Matlab code. Please refer to the descriptions in Matlab/MMGN.


===== Numerical Experiments =====

demo.R shows two examples of running MMGN under the probit and logistic noise models, respectively.
