Code for reproducing Fig 7 in our manuscript 'A Majorization-Minimization Gauss-Newton Method for 1-Bit Matrix Completion'.

Step 1: Run profile_check.m, then you should be able to get the profile_check_t10rho8.mat file (Note this may take 30-60 minutes)

Step 2: Run profile_summary.m to summarize the results we need for the plot.

Step: Run profile_plot.R, then you should be able to get the same figure as in Fig 7 in the manuscript.
