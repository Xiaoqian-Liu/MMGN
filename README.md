# Code for 'A Majorization-Minimization Gauss-Newton Algorithm for 1-Bit Matrix Completion'

Xiaoqian Liu, Xu Han, Eric Chi, and Boaz Nadler (2023). arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13940. 

This repository provides all the code for running the experiments in the manuscript.  

The Matlab folder includes the Matlab implementation of MMGN, the proposed method for 1-bit matrix completion, and five compared methods, including TraceNorm (Davenport et. al. 2024), MaxNorm (Cai and Zhou, 2013), GD (gradient descent with backtracking), LBFGS, and Manopt (manifold optimization). Please find the detailed description for each method under the eponymous subfolders. 

The R folder includes the R implementation of MMGN for 1-bit matrix completion and two compared methods, including 1BitTC (Wang and Li, 2020) and logisticPCA (De Leeuw, 2006). Please find the detailed description for each method under the eponymous subfolders.
